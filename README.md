# fhs-coding-club-bot
A bot made for use in Farragut High School CS Club's Discord server. Capabilities include compiling C++ and Python pasted in chat and returning output, moderation tools, and event management. Intended to be hosted on an isolated Linux server (virtual machine). <br>
Note: DO NOT HOST THIS LOCALLY ON A PERSONAL/SENSITIVE SYSTEM. The program's method of compiling code creates a severe vulnerability on the host system by locally running user-input code. I host this bot on an isolated Ubuntu Server Virtual Machine with no sensitive information and no other utility, with a backup.
